	<h3>Kids Health</h3>
		<p><a href="https://kidshealth.org/">Vist Site</a></p>
	<h3>Evaluation</h3>
		<p>1. Starting with the main menu its very easy to use and has multiple ways of navigating through the website.</p>
		<p>2. It covers its highest demographics in America by having a way to switch from english to spanish.</p>
		<p>3. In terms of coding their main site, it seems to have very little errors, and the ones they have are very insignificant. Going to their alternative site is another story however.</p>
		<p>4. The Educator site seems a lot more dated, and has more errors.</p>
		<p>5.</p>
